Example

Input: str1 = “onetwofour”, str2 = “hellofourtwooneworld”
Output: YES
Explanation: str1 is substring in shuffled form of str2 as
str2 = “hello” + “fourtwoone” + “world”
str2 = “hello” + str1 + “world”, where str1 = “fourtwoone” (shuffled form)
Hence str1 is a substring of str2 in shuffled form.

Input: str1 = “roseyellow”, str2 = “yellow”
Output: NO
Explanation: As length of str1 is greater than str2. Hence str1 is not a substring of str2.

Approach:
Let n = length of str1, m = length of str2.
If n > m, then string str1 can never be substring of str2.
Else sort the string str1.
Traverse string str2
Put all the characters of str2 of length n in another string str.
Sort the string str and Compare str and str1.
If str = str1, then string str1 is a shuffled substring of string str2.
else repeat the above process till ith index of str2 such that (i – n + 1 > m)(as after this index the length of remaining string str2 will be less than str1.
If str is not equals to str1 in above steps, then string str1 can never be substring of str2.

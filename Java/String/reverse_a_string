Following are some interesting facts about String and StringBuffer classes :
1. Objects of String are immutable.
2. String class in Java does not have reverse() method, however StringBuilder class has built in reverse() method.
3. StringBuilder class do not have toCharArray() method, while String class does have toCharArray() method.

StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder except
one difference that StringBuffer is thread safe, i.e., multiple threads can use it without any issue. The thread safety brings a penalty of performance.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String a="Ateet Kurekar";
		StringBuilder n=new StringBuilder();
		n.append(a);
		System.out.println(n.reverse());

	}
